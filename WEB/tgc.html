          <h3>Assignment</h3>
          <p>Sleep is important. The body recovers during sleep. You need a good rest in order to function. The required amount of sleep is 8.5 hours for adults. 6 Hours is considered the absolute minimum, but
            only few are aware of that. Sleep deprived people often find it hard to concentrate and have a higher chance of depression, heart diseases and obesisty. Many people are sleeping insufficient. Gerard
            Kerkhof, professor at the UvA conducted a research and found out that the people in the Netherlands sleep 7 hours at night on average. Also, one third of the population sleeps less than 6 hours.
            Besides, 33 per cent mentioned that they regularly (more than 3 times per week) are having trouble sleeping. </p>
          <p>The number of people that are having trouble falling asleep, sleeping through and  sleeping well in general has increased rapidly in the past 10 years. What is the reason behind this? One explanation
            is that people are experiencing more stress than in the past and therefore can not fall asleep or are being restless. Another factor is the use of digital devices before bedtime. The screen's blue light
            causes the brain and body to want to stay awake. Also, people often work on their laptop at night, receive emails, message other people or are scrolling through social media. Many people use their phone
            as alarm and therefore it is always next to them on their nightstand or bed. This makes it more attractive to go online and check your messages. This leads to people feeling the need to always be available
            and having no rest. Sleeping experts recommend not taking your phone with you in your bedroom.</p>
          <p>The assignment is to design an interactive product that supports sleep. The product has to improve the sleeping experience. You may choose between few moments within the sleeping context: going to bed
            (night routine), falling asleep, sleeping itself and waking up.</p>
